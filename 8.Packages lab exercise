ex1) circumference and area

For a fancy clustering algorithm, you want to find the circumference C and area A of a circle. When the radius of the circle is r, you can calculate C and A as:

C=2πr
A=πr2

# Definition of radius
r = 0.43

# Import the math package
import math

# Calculate C
C = math.pi*2*r

# Calculate A
A = math.pi*r**2

# Build printout
print("Circumference: " + str(C))
print("Area: " + str(A))

Output:
<script.py> output:
    Circumference: 2.701769682087222
    Area: 0.5808804816487527
    
ex2)selective import
Perform a selective import from the math package where you only import the radians function.
Calculate the distance travelled by the Moon over 12 degrees of its orbit. Assign the result to dist. You can calculate this as r∗ϕ, where r is the radius and ϕ is the angle in radians. To convert an angle in degrees to an angle in radians, use the radians() function, which you just imported.
Print out dist.

# Definition of radius
r = 192500

# Import radians function of math package
from math import radians

# Travel distance of Moon if 12 degrees. Store in dist.
dist = r * radians(12)

# Print out dist
print(dist)

Output:
<script.py> output:
    40317.10572106901
