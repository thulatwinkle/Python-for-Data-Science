list is also a datatype

A list is a way to give a single name to a collection of values. 
These values, or elements, can have any type; they can be floats, integer, booleans, strings, but also more advanced Python types, even lists.

eg. 

want to measure the height of everybody in your family, and store this information in python, it would be inconvenient to create a new python variable for each data point
you collected right?
What you can do instead, is store all this information in a python _list_. You can build such a list with square brackets. Suppose you asked your two sisters and parents for their height, in meters. You can build the list as follows:

fam = [ 1.79 , 1.89 , 1.52]

list can contain elements of different datatype
it can contain list also.
eg.
fam = [[ "liz",1.79], ["sam",1.89], ["mac",1.52]]
