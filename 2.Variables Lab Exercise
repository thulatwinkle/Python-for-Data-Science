EX3)
# Several variables to experiment with
savings = 100
factor = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"

# Assign product of factor and savings to year1
year1 = factor * savings

# Print the type of year1 which reflects float type
print(type(year1))

# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = desc + desc

# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)

Output:
    <class 'float'>
    compound interestcompound interest
