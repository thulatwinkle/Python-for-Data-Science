EX1) Your First Numpy Array
# Create list baseball
baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]

# Import the numpy package as np
import numpy as np

# Create a Numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out type of np_baseball
print(np_baseball)
print(type(np_baseball))

Output:
<script.py> output:
    [180 215 210 210 188 176 209 200]

<script.py> output:
    <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
    
    
ex2) covert height in inches to meter

# height is available as a regular list

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a Numpy array from height: np_height
np_height = np.array(height)

# Print out np_height
print(np_height)

# Convert np_height to m: np_height_m
np_height_m = np_height * 0.0254
print(np_height_m)

Output:
<script.py> output:
    [74 74 72 ... 75 75 73]
    [1.8796 1.8796 1.8288 ... 1.905  1.905  1.8542]
    
   
ex3)BMI calculation
# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create array from height with correct units: np_height_m
np_height_m = np.array(height) * 0.0254

# Create array from weight with correct units: np_weight_kg
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight) * 0.453592

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

# Print out bmi
print(bmi)

Output:
<script.py> output:
    [23.11037639 27.60406069 28.48080465 ... 25.62295933 23.74810865
     25.72686361]
     

ex4) subsetting using boolean array
Create a boolean Numpy array: the element of the array should be True if the corresponding baseball player's BMI is below 21. You can use the < operator for this. Name the array light.
Print the array light.
Print out a Numpy array with the BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21. Use light inside square brackets to do a selection on the bmi array.

# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
np_height_m = np.array(height) * 0.0254
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight) * 0.453592
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

# Create the light array
light = bmi <21

# Print out light
print(light)


# Print out BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21
print(bmi[light])

Output:
<script.py> output:
    [False False False ... False False False]
    [20.54255679 20.54255679 20.69282047 20.69282047 20.34343189 20.34343189
     20.69282047 20.15883472 19.4984471  20.69282047 20.9205219 ]
     
     
ex5)subsetting using index
# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Store weight and height lists as numpy arrays
np_weight = np.array(weight)
np_height = np.array(height)

# Print out the weight at index 50
print(weight[50])

# Print out sub-array of np_height: index 100 up to and including index 110
print(np_height[100:111])

Output:
<script.py> output:
    200
    [73 74 72 73 69 72 73 75 75 73 72]
