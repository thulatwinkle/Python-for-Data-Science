ex 1) Average and median
# np_baseball is available

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create np_height from np_baseball
np_height= np.array(np_baseball[:,0])

# Print out the mean of np_height
print(np.mean(np_height))

# Print out the median of np_height
print(np.median(np_height))

Output:
<script.py> output:
    1586.4610837438424
    74.0
    
    
ex2) STD and correlated coeff
# np_baseball is available

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Print mean height (first column)
avg = np.mean(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Average: " + str(avg))

# Print median height. Replace 'None'
med = np.median(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Median: " + str(med))

# Print out the standard deviation on height. Replace 'None'
stddev = np.std(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Standard Deviation: " + str(stddev))

# Print out correlation between first and second column. Replace 'None'
corr =  np.corrcoef(np_baseball[:,0],np_baseball[:,1])
print("Correlation: " + str(corr))


ex4) how to apply statistics in two arrays
# heights and positions are available as lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Convert positions and heights to numpy arrays: np_positions, np_heights

np_positions = np.array(positions)
np_heights = np.array(heights)
print(np_heights)
print(np_positions)
# Heights of the goalkeepers: gk_heights
gk_heights=np_heights[np_positions=='GK'] 

# Heights of the other players: other_heights
other_heights = np_heights[np_positions!='GK']


# Print out the median height of goalkeepers. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of goalkeepers: " + str(np.median(gk_heights)))

# Print out the median height of other players. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of other players: " + str(np.median(other_heights)))

Output:
<script.py> output:
    [191 184 185 ... 183 179 179]
    ['GK' 'M' 'A' ... 'D' 'D' 'M']
    Median height of goalkeepers: 188.0
    Median height of other players: 181.0
