Variables:

Variables are helpful to save value
it is case sensitive

Once you create (or declare) such a variable, you can later call up its value by typing the variable name.
In Python, variables are used all the time. They help to make your code reproducible.


type()
returns the type of variable.
there are int,float,double,str,bool
str represents value in single or double quotes

different type = different behaviour on same variable
eg. 3 + 2 ans: 5
   "ac" + "cd" ans:accd
